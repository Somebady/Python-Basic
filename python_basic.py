"""[In Python, Set is an unordered collection of data type that is iterable,
mutable and has no duplicate elements.
The order of elements in a set is undefined though it may consist of various elements.
The major advantage of using a set, as opposed to a list, is that it has a highly optimized method for checking whether a specific element is contained in the set.]

So map returns the same number of elements as the original, but the element value will be transformed in some way and filter will return the same or less number of elements than the original but not change the original elementsâ€™ values.

The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

The filter() method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.

# # Differect address is assigned here

# # Nested List
# a = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
# a--1000

# a[1]--1020

# b = a.copy()

# b---2000

# # List is assigned to different address in shallow copy but nested list stll

# # Deep Copy
# a---1000
# b = a.copy()

# # In single normal list, shallow copy and Deep copy is same
